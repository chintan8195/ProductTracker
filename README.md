# ProductTracker
A smart contract for a general business model of Product Tracker.
- The code has been audited repeatedly for various attacks and vulnerabilities and used Oyente tool to detect existing vulnerabilities in the smart contract. 
- We attacked the smart contract  by purposely increasing value of a variable to the max value and detected where exactly is the overflow error and did the same thing to detect underflow error. 
- After following these steps we were able to remove the part of the code due to which error occurred.
